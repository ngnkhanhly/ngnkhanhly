👋 Hi there, I'm Nguyen Thi Khanh Ly!

🎓 I'm a fourth-year student majoring in **Data Science in Economics and Business**
at **National Economics University (NEU), Hanoi**.

🚀 I'm interested in building **practical AI systems**, especially in
**Computer Vision, OCR, and document understanding pipelines**.

---

## 🔍 About Me

I focus on designing and evaluating **end-to-end vision pipelines** for real-world use cases.
Rather than only training models, I care about **system-level decisions**, including
accuracy–latency trade-offs, benchmarking, and deployment awareness.

My current interests include:
- OCR systems & information extraction from images
- Object detection and text recognition
- OCR post-processing and LLM-assisted document understanding
- Model evaluation, benchmarking, and failure case analysis

## 🎯 Career Goal

I'm seeking opportunities as:
- AI Engineer Intern
- Computer Vision Engineer (Intern)
- OCR / Document AI Intern

I aim to grow into an **AI Engineer with strong system thinking**
who can design models that work reliably in real-world constraints.
