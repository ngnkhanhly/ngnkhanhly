# 👋 Hi there, I'm Nguyen Thi Khanh Ly!

🎓 I'm a fourth-year student majoring in **Data Science in Economics and Business**
at **National Economics University (NEU), Hanoi**.

🚀 I'm interested in building **practical AI systems**, especially in
**Computer Vision, OCR, and document understanding pipelines**.

---

## 🔍 About Me

I focus on designing and evaluating **end-to-end vision pipelines** for real-world use cases.
Rather than only training models, I care about **system-level decisions**, including
accuracy–latency trade-offs, benchmarking, and deployment awareness.

My current interests include:
- OCR systems & information extraction from images
- Object detection and text recognition
- OCR post-processing and LLM-assisted document understanding
- Model evaluation, benchmarking, and failure case analysis

## 🧠 Technical Interests

- 📷 Computer Vision: Object Detection, OCR, Image Classification  
- 📝 OCR Systems: YOLO, CRNN (CTC), TrOCR, EasyOCR  
- 🤖 LLMs & GenAI: Prompting basics, OCR post-processing (learning in progress)  
- ⚙️ System Thinking: Accuracy–latency trade-offs, deployment-aware model selection

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Languages**
- Python

**Frameworks & Libraries**
- PyTorch, TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

**Modeling**
- CNN, CRNN (CTC Loss)
- Transformer-based vision models

**Training & Evaluation**
- Data preprocessing & annotation handling
- Train / validation / test split
- Metrics: Character Accuracy, Word Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, mAP

**Tools**
- Git, GitHub
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Career Goal

I'm seeking opportunities as:
- AI Engineer Intern
- Computer Vision Engineer (Intern)
- OCR / Document AI Intern

I aim to grow into an **AI Engineer with strong system thinking**
who can design models that work reliably in real-world constraints.
